#rLMS: A Library Management System written in Rust

*Note: This is a project to learn and practice Rust. If this becomes more than that I've lost my mind.*

*Note: I am also attempting ot learn Tera and NodeJS/React at the same time with
this project so it is possible there will be a lot of randomly commented
code looking like it's related to webpages...because it is.*
## Requirements: 
* rustc v1.83.0
* sqlite3 v3.47.2
* nodejs v23.4.0
* npm v10.9.2

It is worth noting that this application makes use of the Open Library API for retreiving the data from books via ISBN.
